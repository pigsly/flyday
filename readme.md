## Introduction

Flyday takes its core philosophy from the concept of migrations in databases. The idea is to streamline the allocation of tasks, ensuring they're effectively prioritized and aptly distributed over time. The primary component of Flyday is the `migrate command`, which is the heart of this task migration system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Create virtualenv   
   
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install necessary dependencies:
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the setup script (if any):
   
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Config

1. conf/ projects.json 
   You must give the planed projects this month. flyday will assign the tasks for a day.

2. conf/ project_tasks.json   
   You can defind the type of project, each type owns the specfic tasks. The task can also defind available spending hours.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided commands to manage your tasks.

### Commands

1. **migrate**  
   Use this command to generate your priority-based work schedule.
